            <h3>We Can't Wait: Restore School Funding</h3>
            
            <p>
                
                <img src="images/stuvoice/0.JPG" alt="meeting with prichard commitee student voice team at KCHS">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
                <p>My sophomore year of high school, my sister-in-law heard about the Prichard Committee Student Voice Team[SVT]
                through her work at Girl Scouts and sent me an email about it. After waiting nervously, I asked my Algebra teacher,
                Bjorn Wastvedt, to help facilitate the connection. I'd never sent an email about something so important before and I
                needed help setting up the initial video call on the school Wifi. Rachel Belin, the Senior Director, spoke with us
                and explained that the SVT was only starting out but that they’d love for me to get involved and invited me to the next
                General meeting via video call. After a few meetings, we scheduled a roundtable at Knox Central High School.
                It was rare that anyone respected students’ ideas or listened to us at my persistently low-achieving high school.
            </div>
                <img src="images/stuvoice/1.jpg" alt="meeting with prichard commitee student voice team at KCHS">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
                <p>The day of the roundtable came and the SVT members drove down from central KY to our rural school in southeastern KY. 
                Bjorn took them on one of the school bus routes and explained the area better before we all convened at the school. 
                They were surprised at how new the school was and my friends and I were taken aback by their professional clothes.
                We discussed our preconceived notions of one another and broke the ice by discussing the shift in our perspective of the expected stereotypes versus reality. 
                After the roundtable discussion on our school’s climate and issues, we moved to an English teacher’s classroom while another roundtable was held with the teachers. 
                The SVT co-founder/student director, Andrew Brennan spoke with us. He looked us in the eyes and said “y’all know you’re a minority, right?”
                I did not know. I was not at all aware that there were scholarships specifically for Appalachian folks or
                that if your parents made under 50k a year and you got into an elite college you’d go for free.
                I was determined to learn everything I possibly could from this team over the coming years. </p>
                <p>When the campaign to restore school funding began, I was full of energy, walking around my school and gathering
                photos with other students for the #WeCantWait social media campaign. I would quote statistics about the funding for
                textbooks and other school materials that we always complained about, but never comprehended that we could change. 
                </p><p>The work that the SVT did resulted in:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> $96 million to restore child care subsidy funds to help working class families
                <li> $18 million to expand preschool for thousands of low-income 4 year olds.
                <li> $9 million for the HANDS home visiting program to ensure more of KY’s youngest kids have a smooth transition from home to school
                <li> $189 million increase in SEEK funding, the state’s main school funding formula
                </ul>

            <h3>Kentucky House Bill 236</h3>
            <img src="images/stuvoice/2.jpg" alt="before meeting with representative Graham">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
            <p>Students are often given tours of the state house or act as a page for a day if they’re lucky, but it’s rare that 
                we have the level of civic engagement that I was privileged to have experienced. This project began when a student 
                wanted a place on their county’s superintendent search committee. Because it was not explicitly allowed in the law, 
                we wanted to propose that a single word change so that a student <i>may</i> be allowed on the five person team.</p> 

                <p>Once we understood what needed to change in the law, we met with Representative Graham to see if he would be
                    willing to sponsor a bill. I didn't speak much in that meeting, in fact, I'm not sure I opened my mouth to say
                    more than "thank you." I came along with the more politically-minded students in order to learn, take notes, and 
                    understand the political process. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/stuvoice/3.jpg" alt="Meeting with Representative Graham">
            
            <div id="engagementtxt">
                <p>The next step, after he agreed to sponsor the bill, was testifying in front of the Kentucky House Education Committee.
                    With three other students from central Kentucky, I sat at a table in front of these adults, ready to justify why we
                    should be allowed to have an active role in our education at all levels. We explained the legal, practical, and moral
                    standpoints on HB236:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Legal: </b>There's nothing explicitly prohibiting a minor having access to the same information as their adult
                        counterparts. If it is a question, the candidate could waive the right for that information to be private.</li>
                        <li><b>Practical: </b>This has worked at other schools in other states, such as Maryland and Massachusetts.  
                        These students would be peer-selected by their middle and high school peers. There are also students who 
                        provide a valuable perspective on the boards at other organizations. The key to success is training.</li>
                        <li><b>Moral: </b>Student success and ownership of their education go hand in hand. The main stakeholders in education
                        deserve representation. In addition, students are able to provide a real-time feedback loop.</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <img src="images/stuvoice/4.jpeg" alt="Testifying to the Kentucky State House">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
                <p>The bill passed the house with a vote of eighty eight to five. It continued on to the Kentucky Senate Education Committee.
                    There, two unfriendly and previously unsuccessful riders were attached: a "bathroom bill" and a religious freedom bill.
                    I was energized by our previous victory, but unable to join the #StandWithStudents #SaveOurBill campaign and rally due to 
                    my father's beliefs. The bill failed.

            <h3>Uncovering the Tripwires to Postsecondary Success</h3>
            <img src="images/stuvoice/5.png" alt="Uncovering the Tripwires to Postsecondary Success report cover">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
            <p>The Postsecondary Project wrote this report after numerous roundtables with students, my own school included.
                We asked students what their concerns were about transitioning to college and how they prepared and then 
                researched further the challenges students face in getting to college. I was able to help with this 
                twenty page report which combined both qualitative and quantitative information: student voices paired with facts.
            </p>
            <p>We identified the following tripwires for Kentucky students:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Birthright Lottery: </b> Making a successful transition from public schools to the postsecondary system
                is greatly affected by a student's family background, income level, and socioeconomic factors such as zip code.</li>
                <li><b>Veiled College Costs: </b> Expenses for college preparation while still in high school or the cost of building
                a quality resume such as extracurricular activities. The ability to handle ongoing college costs: tuition, room and board,
                food, books, transportation, and others.</li>
                <li><b>College & Career Unreadiness: </b>The habits and abilities required to succeed as a college student, from financial
                literacy to studying and time allocation.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Powerball Promise</h3>
            <img src="images/stuvoice/6.jpg" alt="Meeting with Louisville Courier Journal about publishing op-eds">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
            <p>Need-based scholarships which were supposed to be funded by the lottery had funds being diverted from them.
                This diversion cost a lost of 20,000 Kentucky students' scholarships. Students partnered with Kentucky 
                Center for Economic Policy, the Association of Independent Kentucky Colleges and Universities, and the 
                Hope Street Group, to advocate for restoring the funds. We gathered in the rotunda to hear from students
                who were ready for college but had no way to go. We had a number of students holding signs and speaking, 
                so I was able to step back and take photos of this event. 
                </p>
                <p>This advocacy effort resulted in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kentucky General Assembly allocating 55 million more dollars to scholarships over the biennium</li>
                    <li>Remaining lottery funds being allocated to Work Ready Kentucky, 
                        a promising new program to help students attend two-year institutions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
                <img src="images/stuvoice/7.jpg" alt="Poorer Students Need More from Policymakers">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
            <p>In the midst of all of this work, my article, <i>Poorer Students Need More from Policymakers</i> was 
                published in the Louisville Courier-Journal and the Gear Up Gazette. Because of this work being published,
                a private college counselor, Jane Shropshire, took me on pro-bono and guided me through the college application
                process. Another retired teacher reached out and offered to help me financially through the college transition.
                This work truly allowed us to advocate for ourselves, develop professionally, and in turn gain valuable networks
                 of supportive peers and adults.</p>

            <img src="images/stuvoice/8.jpg" alt="Ready or not: stories from the students behind the statistics book cover">
            <div id="engagementtxt">
            <p>The Prichard Committee Student Voice Team wrote a book to follow up all of these valuable projects. I was fortunate
                to be able to consult on it and aid in the editing process all the way from Wellesley. The book covers college readiness:
                financial aid, admissions, guidance counseling, the value of ACT scores, and more. It follows a similar fact-voice pairing
                as Tripwires. These accounts are essential to our current national discussion about college, standardized testing, and
                the value of education for rural America.
